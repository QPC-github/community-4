This repository does not hold any code.

It is just for the discussion of TREZOR Developer Community via GitHub issues.

It allows us to use familiar web interface together with email notifications and also replies via email.

This is not a support channel for TREZOR users. If you have an user question or problem, try [TREZOR subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TREZOR) or [TREZOR Telegram group](https://t.me/trezortalk) first. If the problem persists, visit our [Support Center](https://trezor.io/support/).

Also, please, read our documentation, before asking a question, so you can be sure you understand the concept and don't ask something that has already been explained:

* [TREZOR User Manual](https://wiki.trezor.io/User_manual)
* [TREZOR FAQ](https://wiki.trezor.io/FAQ)
* [TREZOR Security](https://wiki.trezor.io/Security)
